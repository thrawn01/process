#### Process Pool Experiment
This is a library for communicating with a child process. The pool creates a
child in the pool and communicates with it. The intent was to bridge the gap
between golang and python by having a pool of python interpreters running as
child processes with golang sending the pyton interpreters instructions and
recieving a result.

This library is as of yet, not used. But might be in the future.
